## Color Sync

It's probably best to run this in a virtual environment, I used venv. \
To activate venv on Linux or Mac run `source ./bin/activate` \
On Windows `may god help you` \
You will need to replace the homeassistant url, token and the id of your lights in the code \
Then just start the program with `python avg_color.py`
